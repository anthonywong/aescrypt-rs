# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),  
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-rc.8] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- **`secure-gate`** updated to **`=0.9.0-rc.5`** (exact pin); refresh **`Cargo.lock`** for new transitive versions. No public API changes were required in this codebase for the rc.5 upgrade.

### Note

- Still waiting on secure-gate stable release to make v0.2.0 stable release.

## [0.2.0-rc.7] - 2026-03-23

### Note

- Waiting on secure-gate stable release to make v0.2.0 stable release.

### Breaking Changes

- **Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.85** (previously 1.75). Projects or CI pinned to older toolchains must upgrade rustc.

### Changed

- **Rust edition 2024** — `edition = "2024"` in `Cargo.toml` (no source rewrites needed in this crate; `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and I/O `match read` patterns avoid typical edition-2024 migration hazards).
- **`secure-gate`** updated to **`=0.9.0-rc.2`** (exact pin); refresh **`Cargo.lock`** for new transitive versions (e.g. `getrandom` 0.4, `rand` 0.10). No public API changes were required in this codebase for the 0.9 upgrade.
- **`criterion`** (dev-dependency) held at **0.7** — **criterion 0.8.x** declares **rustc 1.86+**, which would exceed the declared MSRV 1.85. Benchmarks remain on Criterion 0.7 until MSRV is raised or criterion’s MSRV aligns.
- **Decryption stream** (`decrypt_ciphertext_stream` / trailer): factored repeated payload HMAC verification into `verify_payload_hmac`; rewrote v1/v2 `extract_hmac_scattered` to use wrap-around ring indexing (`% 64`) like `extract_hmac_simple` instead of slice copies that relied on an implicit `tail_index` alignment invariant; clarified PKCS#7 final-block validation and trailer module comments. **No intentional on-wire or output behavior change** for valid `.aes` files.
- **Encryption** (`encrypt`, `encrypt_stream`, `write`, `mod`): removed stale development comments from source; HMAC construction now uses explicit `.expect(...)` messages (aligned with the decryption path); removed dead commented-out `encrypt_fixed_session` stubs from `encryption/mod.rs`.
- **Tests** (`vector_tests`): removed duplicate deterministic v3 round-trip from `roundtrip_all_versions`, dropped redundant empty-input size, tightened comments and `DeterministicVector` field visibility — same coverage, less noise.

### Added

- **README**: MSRV badge (shields.io) aligned with `rust-version = "1.85"`.

## [0.2.0-rc.6] - 2026-03-21

### Breaking Changes

- Removed optional crate features `zeroize` and `rand`. The library always enables `aes`’s `zeroize` integration, always enables secure-gate `rand` and `ct-eq`, uses constant-time comparisons unconditionally, and always compiles `encrypt()` with CSPRNG-backed IV/key generation. Drop `--no-default-features` / `--features zeroize` / `--features rand` from downstream manifests.

### Security

- **Streaming encryption (`encrypt_stream`)**: Read plaintext in a loop until each 16-byte block is full (or EOF). A single short `Read::read` is no longer treated as end-of-file, which could have truncated ciphertext silently (AUDIT_020RC6 H1).
- **Streaming decryption (`decrypt_cbc_loop`)**: Accumulate the 48-byte bootstrap read and each 16-byte ciphertext block the same way, so stingy readers (sockets, pipes, test adapters) no longer skip the CBC loop or mis-handle blocks (AUDIT_020RC6 H2).
- **Header parsing**: For file versions 1–3, the reserved byte after the version must be `0x00`; non-zero values are rejected (AUDIT_020RC6 M1).
- **Extensions**: Header extension parsing is capped at 256 extensions to bound work on malicious inputs (AUDIT_020RC6 L5).

### Fixed

- Unified v3 PKCS#7 padding error text to `v3: invalid PKCS#7 padding` in both validation paths (AUDIT_020RC6 L1).
- PBKDF2 iteration count `0` is clamped to `1` consistently in `Pbkdf2Builder::with_iterations` and low-level derivation (AUDIT_020RC6 M3).
- Documentation: `decrypt()` now documents streaming output before HMAC verification (discard output on error), empty-password behavior vs `encrypt()`, corrected `xor_blocks` documentation (panics instead of misleading UB wording), and an ACKDF note on SHA-256 state not being explicitly zeroized (AUDIT_020RC6 H3, L2, L3, L4).
- `Cargo.toml`: inline comment documenting the pre-release `secure-gate` pin (AUDIT_020RC6 M2); removed unused direct `rand` dependency (AUDIT_020RC6 L6).
- Typo fix in crate-level docs in `lib.rs` (AUDIT_020RC6 L8).
- Tests: stingy-reader encrypt/decrypt round-trips, reserved-byte rejection, extension limit, and updated PKCS#7 assertion (AUDIT_020RC6 test plan).

### Changed

- Updated `secure-gate` dependency to v0.8.0-rc.1 and migrated all trait imports from `ExposeSecret`/`ExposeSecretMut` to `RevealSecret`/`RevealSecretMut` (secure-gate 0.8 rename). Import `ConstantTimeEq` where `.ct_eq()` is used on `Fixed` wrappers.
- Documentation: constant-time equality is described via secure-gate’s [`ConstantTimeEq`](https://docs.rs/secure-gate/latest/secure_gate/trait.ConstantTimeEq.html) trait (`ct-eq` feature), not the removed `SecureConversionsExt` / conversions-module path.

## [0.2.0-rc.1 - rc.5] - 2026-02-02

**Clean slate release**: Complete API redesign focused on core encryption/decryption functionality. All non-essential features have been removed for a minimal, focused library.

**Thread Safety**: All public functions are thread-safe (`Send + Sync`). The library has no shared mutable state, making all operations safe for concurrent use from multiple threads, async runtimes, and custom cancellation implementations.

### Breaking Changes

- **Complete removal of conversion functionality**: Deleted `convert_to_v3()` function and entire `convert` module. No migration path provided - this is a clean break.
- **Complete removal of batch operations**: Deleted `batch_ops` module, `encrypt_batch()`, `decrypt_batch()` functions, and `batch-ops` feature. Removed `rayon` dependency.
- **Module reorganization**: Renamed `decryptor` → `decryption`, `encryptor` → `encryption` (aligns with Rust naming conventions for process/domain modules).
- Replaced all short aliases with explicit, size-tagged CamelCase names (e.g., `Aes256Key` → `Aes256Key32`, `Iv16` remains, `EncryptedSessionBlock48` unchanged).
- Random aliases now size-tagged (e.g., `RandomAes256Key32`).
- Public API in `lib.rs` completely redesigned with minimal, focused exports.

### Security

- **Fixed timing attack vulnerabilities**: All HMAC comparisons now use constant-time operations via `secure-gate`'s `ct_eq()` method.
  - Session HMAC verification uses constant-time comparison.
  - Stream HMAC verification (v0, v1/v2, v3) uses constant-time comparison.
- **Fixed PKCS#7 padding validation timing leak**: Padding validation now always compares a fixed 16-byte block instead of variable-length slices, preventing timing attacks that could reveal padding values.
- All constant-time operations use `secure-gate::conversions::SecureConversionsExt::ct_eq()`, which leverages `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` internally.

### Added

- Generic `SpanBuffer<const N: usize>` as secure stack buffer (alias to `secure-gate::Fixed<[u8; N]>`).
- Strongly-typed sub-types of `SpanBuffer` for semantic clarity: `Block16`, `Trailer32`, `Trailer33`, `InitialRead48`, `Pbkdf2HashState32`, `Pbkdf2DerivedKey32`, `AckdfHashState32`.
- **`Pbkdf2Builder`**: Fluent builder API for PBKDF2 key derivation with sensible defaults (300k iterations, random salt).
- Comprehensive rust-doc documentation for all public modules and functions.
- **Thread safety documentation**: All public functions documented as thread-safe with examples for threaded usage, async runtimes, and cancellation patterns.
- `PBKDF2_MIN_ITER`, `PBKDF2_MAX_ITER`, `DEFAULT_PBKDF2_ITERATIONS`, and `AESCRYPT_LATEST_VERSION` constants for consistent validation and configuration.
- Advanced API access via module paths: `decryption::extract_session_data()`, `decryption::StreamConfig`, `encryption::derive_setup_key()`, and other low-level functions for custom flows.
- Utility functions: `utilities::utf8_to_utf16le()` for legacy password encoding, `utilities::xor_blocks()` for block operations.

### Changed

- **Module reorganization**: Renamed `src/decryptor/` to `src/decryption/` and `src/encryptor/` to `src/encryption/` for better alignment with Rust naming conventions.
- Renamed `utils.rs` to `utilities.rs` and `consts.rs` to `constants.rs` for module naming consistency.
- Moved `derive_setup_key` from `encryption/write.rs` to `encryption/session.rs` for better cohesion.
- Hardened ACKDF temporary hash buffer with `AckdfHashState32`.
- Updated all internal code, tests, and benchmarks to use new alias names.
- Renamed `src/decryption/stream/utilities.rs` to `src/decryption/stream/trailer.rs` for better clarity.
- Enhanced KDF iteration validation with consistent bounds checking using `PBKDF2_MIN_ITER` constant.
- `Pbkdf2Builder` now uses `DEFAULT_PBKDF2_ITERATIONS` (300,000) as the default iteration count.
- Updated `secure-gate` dependency to v0.7.0-rc.14, incorporating major breaking changes: transitioned random generation from deprecated aliases to `Fixed::from_random()` methods, updated HMAC verification to use wrapper `.ct_eq()` methods for constant-time comparisons on secure types, adapted all code for the new exposure API (existing `.expose_secret()` calls remain compatible), removed auto-`Clone` from wrappers requiring explicit `CloneableType` markers (added manual `Clone` impl to `Pbkdf2Builder`), updated import paths for `ExposeSecret`/`ExposeSecretMut` traits, and adjusted type conversions for session data copying.
- Gated `ct_eq` operations behind the `zeroize` feature and made `rand` feature optional.
- Moved test-only dependencies to `[dev-dependencies]`.
- Code formatting and improved readability in encryption modules.
- Removed all references to deprecated/removed functionality from documentation and examples.

### Removed

- **`convert` module**: Completely deleted. All file conversion functionality removed (`convert_to_v3()` and all related code).
- **`batch_ops` module**: Completely deleted. All parallel batch processing functionality removed (`encrypt_batch()`, `decrypt_batch()`, and all related code).
- **Dependencies**: Removed `pipe` and `rayon` dependencies (no longer needed).
- **Features**: Removed `batch-ops` feature flag entirely.
- Unused or redundant aliases (e.g., `PrevCiphertextBlock16` replaced by `Block16`).
- `encrypt_with_fixed_session` function and associated deterministic encryption test file.
- All test files and benchmarks related to removed functionality.

### Fixed

- Resolved HMAC constructor ambiguity in session extraction.
- Fixed compiler warnings and disabled `ai_assumptions_tests`.
- Removed useless conversions (clippy warnings).
- Cleaned up `.gitignore` by removing redundant patterns.

**Result**: Clean, minimal API focused solely on core encryption/decryption operations.

**API Structure**:

- **Root level**: `encrypt()`, `decrypt()`, `read_version()`, `AescryptError`, `Pbkdf2Builder`, and KDF functions (`derive_ackdf_key()`, `derive_pbkdf2_key()`)
- **Module access**: Advanced users can access lower-level functions via `decryption::*` and `encryption::*` module paths
- **Utilities**: `utilities::utf8_to_utf16le()`, `utilities::xor_blocks()` for custom implementations
- **Constants**: All configuration constants available via `constants::*` module

All tests (including 63 vectors) pass with and without `zeroize`. The library is now streamlined with no legacy baggage - a fresh start for v0.2.0.

## [0.1.6] - 2025-12-03

### Features

- Added `convert_to_v3_ext` — supports separate old/new passwords and **256-bit random password generation**
  - `new_password = None` → generates secure 64-char hex password (256-bit entropy)
  - Uses `RandomPassword32::random_hex()` (secure-gate v0.5.10 best practice)

### Deprecations

- Soft-deprecated `convert_to_v3` (since 0.1.6)
  - Still fully supported and backward compatible
  - Thin wrapper added so old code keeps compiling with a helpful warning
  - Will be removed in v1.0

### Internal

- All new code uses `PasswordString` and `RandomPassword32` aliases
- No breaking changes — safe upgrade for all users

## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-03

### Added

- **Quick version detection**: New `read_version<R: Read>() -> Result<u8, AescryptError>` for header-only file checks (#17)  
  → Reads just 3–5 bytes to extract/validate version (0–3) + magic ("AES")  
  → Errors on invalid magic, short files, or bad reserved bytes  
  → Perfect for batch validation, legacy detection, or CLI tools
  - No crypto/KDF deps, fully `no_std`, <1μs per file
  - 100% tested against all 63 official v0–v3 vectors + edges (invalid/short/malformed)
  - Closes #17

### Changed

- **Upgraded `secure-gate` to v0.5.10 and adopted its new zero-cost random aliases** (#42)  
  → All cryptographically secure random values (`public_iv`, `session_iv`, `session_key`) are now created with the brand-new `RandomIv16::new()` and `RandomAes256Key::new()` types introduced in secure-gate 0.5.10
  - Replaces the previous `Iv16::random()` / `Aes256Key::random()` calls
  - Zero-cost, panic-on-failure, thread-local `OsRng` (exactly the same underlying implementation)
  - Cleaner, more explicit intent at the call site
  - No allocation, no behavior change, no performance regression (benchmarks unchanged)

### Maintenance

- Added the new `RandomIv16` and `RandomAes256Key` aliases to `src/aliases/mod.rs`
- Minor import tidy-up in `encrypt.rs` – removed unused `SecureRandomExt` re-export

A tiny but extremely satisfying ergonomics win — the encryption path now reads like pure intent while staying 100% locked down with secure-gate’s gold-standard memory safety.

## [0.1.4] – 2025-11-29

### Security

- Removed `convert_to_v3_to_vec` entirely. It allocated the entire plaintext in a `Vec<u8>`,
  violating the streaming guarantee and creating unnecessary memory-exposure risk.
  Use `convert_to_v3` with any `Write` (including `Vec<u8>` if you really need it).

## [0.1.3] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- **`convert_to_v3_to_vec`** – new convenience function that converts legacy v0/v1/v2 files to v3 and returns an owned `Vec<u8>`  
  This eliminates the painful `'static` mutable writer requirement that made testing and one-off conversions extremely difficult.  
  Internally uses `thread::scope` for safe, zero-cost streaming (no `Box::leak`, no `unsafe`, no extra cloning).  
  Greatly improves ergonomics for downstream crates like `encrypted-file-vault`.

### Fixed

- Lifetime and borrow-checker issues when using `convert_to_v3` with stack-allocated buffers (the root cause of many test failures).

### Documentation

- Added detailed comments and examples for the new `convert_to_v3_to_vec` API.

Thanks to the heroic struggle against the borrow checker — this release finally makes the conversion API pleasant to use.

## [0.1.2] – 2025-11-28

### Fixed

- Fixed error propagation in `convert_to_v3`: decryption errors are no longer masked by the background encryption thread. Failures now surface correctly and immediately.

### Maintenance

- Ran `cargo machete` and ruthlessly purged all unused dependencies. Cargo.toml is once again pristine and minimal.

No experimental channels, no dead code, no wasted bytes — just a tiny but important bug fix and a cleaner dependency tree.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-27

### Changed

- **Upgraded `secure-gate` to v0.5.7** and enabled its new `rand` feature  
  → All cryptographically secure random values (`Aes256Key`, `Iv16`, salts, etc.) are now generated with `SecureRandomExt::random()` from `secure-gate`
  - Removes the duplicated RNG implementation (`src/crypto/rng.rs` → deleted)
  - Zero-cost, thread-local `OsRng`, lazy-initialized, fully `no_std`-compatible
  - Panics on RNG failure (high-assurance crypto standard)
  - No behavior or performance regression — benchmarks remain identical (>160 MiB/s encrypt, >170 MiB/s decrypt)

### Fixed

- Minor internal clean-ups and import tidy-ups after the RNG migration

### Documentation

- Updated dependency list and feature explanations in `README.md` to reflect the new `secure-gate` version

No breaking changes — fully backward compatible with 0.1.0.
All 100+ tests (including bit-perfect v0–v3 round-trips and deterministic vectors) continue to pass.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **Initial public release** – full-featured, production-ready implementation of the AES Crypt file format (v0–v3)
- Full **read support** for all official versions (v0, v1, v2, v3)
- Full **write support** for modern **v3** format only (PBKDF2-SHA256, PKCS#7 padding, UTF-8 passwords, proper session key encryption)
- High-level API: `encrypt()` and `decrypt()` with `std::io::Read`/`Write` streaming
- `convert_to_v3()` for seamless migration of legacy files to modern v3 format
- Batch processing API: `encrypt_batch()` and `decrypt_batch()` with optional Rayon parallelism (via `batch-ops` feature)
- Secure memory handling via [`secure-gate`](https://github.com/Slurp9187/secure-gate) v0.5.6+ with full `zeroize` integration (enabled by default)
- Constant-memory streaming decryption using a 64-byte ring buffer (no heap allocations during bulk processing)
- Comprehensive test suite:
  - 100% passing round-trip tests against official AES Crypt v0–v3 reference files
  - Deterministic v3 test vectors with known public IV, session IV, and session key
  - KDF edge-case tests (ACKDF, PBKDF2, unicode passwords, empty inputs)
- Benchmark suite using Criterion.rs (`cargo bench`) with realistic 1 KiB → 10 MiB workloads
- `#![no_std]`-compatible core (only `std` feature adds convenience wrappers)
- Detailed documentation and examples in `README.md`
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions) with full test + bench matrix

### Security

- All sensitive values (keys, IVs, passwords) wrapped in `secure-gate` types
- Automatic zeroing on drop via `zeroize` (default feature)
- No `unsafe` code in the core encryption/decryption paths when `zeroize` is enabled
- PBKDF2 iteration count bounds enforced (1 to 5,000,000)
- Default recommended 300,000 iterations (~180 ms on i7-10510U)

### Performance

- Real-world benchmarks on Intel i7-10510U (4c/8t, 16 GB RAM, Windows 11):
  - Decrypt 10 MiB → **~171 MiB/s**
  - Encrypt 10 MiB (with KDF) → **~160 MiB/s**
  - Full round-trip 10 MiB → **~76 MiB/s**
- Expect **>1 GiB/s** on modern desktop CPUs and Apple Silicon

### Notes

- This release is intentionally **v3-only on write** — legacy v0–v2 formats are supported for decryption only.
- The library is **independent** and contains **no code** from the original AES Crypt C++ implementation.

This is the first stable, crate-publishable version. Ready for `cargo publish`!
